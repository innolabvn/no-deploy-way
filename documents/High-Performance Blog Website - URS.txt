## User Requirements Specification (URS)

Project: High-Performance Blog Website
Version: 1.0
Date: May 2025

---

### 1. Purpose

This document defines the user requirements for a high-performance blog website. The blog is intended to provide high availability, fast page loading, scalability under load, and support for typical blog functionalities such as post creation, commenting, and subscriptions. The URS will serve as a basis for development, testing, and UAT validation.

### 2. Scope

This website is aimed at:

* Public users who browse and read blog content.
* Administrators who create and manage blog posts, comments, and subscriptions.
* The system must be accessible on desktop and mobile devices.
* The focus of this URS is on performance-related expectations under realistic workload conditions.

### 6. Technical Principles and Constraints

| ID    | Principle / Constraint | Detail                                                                                           |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| TC-01 | Performance Goal   	 | Homepage and key content pages must load under 1.5s for 95% of global users.                     |
| TC-02 | Caching            	 | Use Redis and HTTP headers for dynamic and static content caching.                               |
| TC-03 | CDN                	 | All static content (JS, CSS, images, HTML) must be served via a global CDN.                      |
| TC-04 | Scalability        	 | System must support 300 concurrent users with no 5xx errors.                                     |
| TC-05 | API Response Time  	 | All public APIs must respond < 300ms for 90th percentile requests.                               |
| TC-06 | Resilience         	 | After a server restart, system should recover fully within 30 seconds.                           |
| TC-07 | Rate Limiting      	 | Limit request burst from bots and crawlers (e.g. 100 req/sec max).                               |
| TC-08 | SEO Compliance     	 | Page structure must follow SEO best practices (sitemap.xml, robots.txt, meta tags).              |
| TC-09 | Security           	 | All data must be transmitted via HTTPS. Input fields must be sanitized to prevent XSS/SQLi.      |
| TC-10 | Monitoring         	 | Integrate APM (Application Performance Monitoring) and Alerting tools (e.g., New Relic, Sentry). |
